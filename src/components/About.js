        Nice to meet you! I'm Dylan, a UX Designer turned Software Engineer
        stretching the possibilities of the front end. I first became interested
        in coding in high school, taking a CS course and continued taking a few
        coding classes along with my major, UX Design at UCSD. <br />
        <br />I graduated with the skills of designing a front end, but wanted
        the ability to create it as well, leading me to Hack Reactor where I
        learned the skills I needed, and so much more along with the back end to
        power it. I'm now creating my own applications and exploring the depths
        of front end possibilities, start to finish with designing my own web
        apps and building them out as finished products.
